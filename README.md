üìà Real-Time Cryptocurrency Price Monitoring Pipeline
A Python-based solution for fetching, processing, and visualizing live crypto prices.

‚ú® Overview
This project showcases a streamlined data pipeline designed to track and visualize cryptocurrency prices in near real-time. Primarily built for use in Google Colab, it offers a hands-on example of how to construct a robust data flow, from raw data ingestion to actionable insights and dynamic visualizations.

It continuously fetches live price data for selected cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin and Ethereum) against specified fiat currencies (USD, INR) using a public API. This raw data is then processed, aggregated over time, and finally, rendered into an insightful time-series plot.

üöÄ Features at a Glance
Live Data Ingestion: Seamlessly pulls current market data directly from the CoinGecko API.

Efficient Data Processing: Leverages Pandas for robust data manipulation, cleaning, and structuring.

Time-Series Data Collection: Simulates continuous monitoring by collecting data points at regular intervals.

Unified Data Aggregation: Combines all collected data into a single, comprehensive dataset for holistic analysis.

Dynamic Visualization: Utilizes Matplotlib to generate clear and insightful line plots, saved as images for easy sharing and reporting.

Modular Pipeline Design: Code is structured into distinct, reusable functions, representing each stage of a well-defined data pipeline.

Basic Error Handling: Includes try-except blocks to manage potential API issues, ensuring a more resilient pipeline.

üìÇ Project Structure
For simplicity and ease of use in Google Colab, the entire pipeline logic resides within a single Python script.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run in Google Colab
This project is optimized for a quick setup and execution in Google Colab.

Prerequisites
A Google Account (to access Google Colab).

Step-by-Step Guide
Open Google Colab:

Navigate to Google Colab.

Start a new notebook by clicking File > New notebook.

Paste the Code:

Copy the entire content of the main.py script (from the latest version you have) and paste it directly into the first code cell of your new Colab notebook.

Execute the Cell:

Click the "Play" button" (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) on the left side of the code cell, or press Shift + Enter.

Observe the output messages in the console, indicating the progress of data collection. There's a built-in delay between iterations to simulate real-world polling and respect API rate limits.

Access the Results:

Once the execution completes, a plot named crypto_price_trend.png will be generated.

To view or download it, click the "Files" icon (üìÅ) in the left sidebar of your Colab notebook.

Expand the output folder, then double-click crypto_price_trend.png to preview it directly, or right-click and choose Download to save it to your computer.

üë®‚Äçüíª Core Pipeline Stages (Code Insight)
The main_pipeline_run() function orchestrates the entire flow:

1. Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è
Sets up essential parameters like the number of iterations, delay between fetches, target cryptocurrency IDs (e.g., "bitcoin,ethereum"), and desired fiat currencies (e.g., "usd,inr").

2. Data Collection & Processing Loop üìä
(collect_and_process_multiple_times)
This is the dynamic heart of the pipeline, iterating a set number of times:

Data Ingestion (get_crypto_price_data): Makes live API calls to CoinGecko. Includes basic error handling with a fallback to simulated data if the API is unreachable.

Data Processing (process_crypto_data): Transforms raw JSON responses into clean, structured Pandas DataFrames.

Data Aggregation: Each processed data point is appended to a global DataFrame (all_collected_data_df), cumulatively building a comprehensive time-series dataset.

Interval Delay: A time.sleep() pause is introduced to manage API rate limits and simulate real-time polling.

3. Visualization & Output üìâ
(visualize_crypto_prices)

Takes the final aggregated DataFrame.

Uses matplotlib to generate a dynamic line plot, illustrating price trends over the collected period for each cryptocurrency.

The generated plot is then saved as a PNG image in the output/ directory for easy access and sharing.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python 3

pandas: Powerful data structures and data analysis tools.

matplotlib: Comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

requests: Elegant and simple HTTP library for making API calls.

CoinGecko API: Source for live cryptocurrency price data.

üí° Future Enhancements
External Configuration: Move parameters like coin IDs and currencies to an external config.ini or config.json file.

Persistent Storage: Integrate with cloud solutions (e.g., Google Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Firestore) or a local database for more robust data persistence beyond the Colab session.

Interactive Dashboard: Develop a real-time web dashboard using frameworks like Streamlit or Plotly Dash for more dynamic visualization and user interaction.

Advanced Analytics: Implement predictive modeling, anomaly detection, or other advanced time-series analysis techniques.

Alerting System: Set up notifications (e.g., email, push notifications) for significant price movements or pipeline anomalies.

Comprehensive Logging: Enhance logging for better debugging, monitoring, and auditing of pipeline runs.
