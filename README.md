üìà Real-Time Cryptocurrency Price Monitoring Pipeline
This project implements a simple, yet effective, Python-based data pipeline to fetch, process, and visualize real-time cryptocurrency prices. Designed to be easily runnable in Google Colab, it provides a practical example of building a data pipeline for dynamic financial data.

üåü Overview
The core purpose of this project is to simulate a continuous data collection process for cryptocurrency prices. It connects to a public API (CoinGecko) to retrieve live price data for selected cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum) against specified fiat currencies (USD, INR). The collected data is then processed, aggregated, and visualized as a time-series plot, showcasing price trends.

‚ú® Features
Real-Time Data Ingestion: Fetches live cryptocurrency prices from the CoinGecko API.

Data Processing: Cleans and structures raw JSON data into a tabular format using Pandas DataFrames.

Time-Series Data Collection: Simulates continuous data collection over predefined intervals.

Data Aggregation: Combines multiple data points collected over time into a single dataset.

Dynamic Visualization: Generates and saves a line plot displaying cryptocurrency price trends.

Modular Pipeline: Organizes the data flow into clear, distinct functions representing pipeline stages.

Error Handling (Basic): Includes basic try-except blocks for API calls to ensure robustness.

üìÇ Directory Structure
Since this project is designed for Google Colab, the primary file is main.py (which would be the content of your Colab cell). When executed, it creates an output directory to store the generated plot.

.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                   # The main script containing the data pipeline logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ output/                   # Directory for generated output (e.g., price trend plots)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ crypto_price_trend.png  # The generated cryptocurrency price trend plot

üöÄ How to Use (Google Colab)
This project is set up to run seamlessly in Google Colab.

Prerequisites
A Google account to access Google Colab.

Steps to Run
Open Google Colab:

Go to Google Colab.

Click on "File" > "New notebook" to create a new, blank Colab notebook.

Paste the Code:

Copy the entire content of the main.py script (provided in the previous response, or copy the latest version directly from your Colab cell).

Paste this code into the first code cell of your new Colab notebook.

Execute the Cell:

Click the "Play" button (triangle icon) on the left side of the code cell, or press Shift + Enter.

The script will start executing, printing progress messages to the output console. There will be a time.sleep() delay between data collection iterations, simulating real-world polling intervals.

View Results:

Once the execution completes, a plot named crypto_price_trend.png will be generated and saved within an output directory in your Colab session's file system.

To view or download the plot:

Click on the "Files" icon (folder icon) in the left sidebar of your Colab notebook.

Navigate into the output folder.

You can double-click crypto_price_trend.png to preview it in Colab, or right-click and select "Download" to save it to your local machine.

üë®‚Äçüíª Code Explained (Pipeline Stages)
The main_pipeline_run() function orchestrates the entire process, broken down into the following logical stages:

Configuration: Defines essential parameters such as the number of data collection iterations, the delay between each collection, the cryptocurrency IDs to track (e.g., "bitcoin", "ethereum"), and the target currencies (e.g., "usd", "inr").

Data Collection Loop (collect_and_process_multiple_times):

This is the core "real-time" component. It iterates a specified number of times.

Data Ingestion (get_crypto_price_data): Makes an HTTP GET request to the CoinGecko API to fetch live price data. Includes basic error handling and falls back to simulated data if the API call fails.

Data Processing (process_crypto_data): Takes the raw JSON response from the API, extracts relevant price information, normalizes it, and transforms it into a Pandas DataFrame.

Data Aggregation: Each processed data point from an iteration is appended to a global DataFrame (all_collected_data_df), building a cumulative time-series dataset.

Interval Delay: A time.sleep() pause is introduced between iterations to simulate real-world polling intervals and respect API rate limits.

Visualization (visualize_crypto_prices):

Takes the aggregated DataFrame containing all collected price data.

Uses matplotlib to generate a line plot, showing the price trend of each cryptocurrency over the collection period.

The plot is saved as a PNG image to the output/ directory, making it easy to share or review.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python 3

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

matplotlib: For creating data visualizations.

requests: For making HTTP requests to external APIs.

üöÄ Future Enhancements
Configuration File: Externalize parameters (like coin IDs, currencies, API key if needed) into a separate configuration file (e.g., config.ini or config.json).

Cloud Data Storage: Instead of an in-memory DataFrame, store collected data in a more persistent solution like Google Cloud Storage, BigQuery, or a small database.

Dashboard Integration: Use libraries like Plotly Dash or Streamlit to build an interactive web dashboard for real-time visualization.

Advanced Analytics: Implement more sophisticated time-series analysis techniques (e.g., moving averages, volatility calculations, predictive models).

Alerting: Set up alerts for significant price changes or anomalies.

Logging: Implement more comprehensive logging for better monitoring and debugging.
